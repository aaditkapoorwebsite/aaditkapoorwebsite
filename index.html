This app provides a smart, efficient way to help the schools. Nowadays parents worry about their child and they seem very scared when their child is returning from school. They want to track child’s location, they need a way that ensures the safety of their child. This app solves this problem as it provides this functionality. Parents are given a unique ID, through this, they can have real time location of the student on the app itself. This app was a result of a joint effort by me and my friends.
